# Vanilla JS Academy Projects

My solutions to the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com) projects.

> The Vanilla JS Academy is a project-based training program designed to help you learn to solve problems and think in JavaScript.

Taught by [Chris Ferdinandi](https://twitter.com/ChrisFerdinandi), author of the [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com) website, the [Vanilla JS Toolkit](https://vanillajstoolkit.com), and the [Vanilla JS Pocket Guides](https://vanillajsguides.com) – all highly recommended if you are starting to learn JS or need a refresher.
